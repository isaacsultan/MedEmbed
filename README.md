# MedEmbed

An end-to-end tool to train relevent word embedding models on medical clinical texts.

## Project Motivation

Word embeddings are arguably the most widely known best practice in the recent history of NLP.

No pre-trained word embedding models exist for *Radiological Oncology*, and many other medical specialties.
Generating word embeddings on raw clinical texts, present unique challenges on account of a lack of consistant formatting
and the prevelence of specialist vocabulary.
